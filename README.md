# HelloWorld
Just a "Hello World" execution.

It's widely known, that a "Hello World" execution is the first step of someone who want to start coding.
Create such a program has almost become a tradition!
It's my first time to use GitHub, so I'll just write a "Hello World" program here.
Wish you have a good time here!
